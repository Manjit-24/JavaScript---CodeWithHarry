// Practice Set

// 1. Create a variable of type string and try to add a number to it.

let a = "Manjit";
let b = 24;
let c = a+b;
console.log(c);


// 2. Use typeof operator to find the datatype of the string in last question.

console.log(typeof c); // string


// 3. Create a const object in javascript can you change it to hold a number later?

const z = {
    name: "Manjit",
    section: 1,
    isPrincipal: false
}
// z = "Manjit" // error


// 4. Try to add a new key to the const object in problem 3. Were you able to do it?

z ['friend'] = "Mark";
console.log(z);


// 5. Write a JS program to create a word-meaning dictionary of 5 words.

const dict = {
    appreciate: "recognize the full worth of.",
    ataraxia: "a state of freedom from emotional disturbance and anxiety.",
    yakka: "work, especially hard work.",
    yakshagana: "a traditional form of music, dance, and theatre from the Indian state of Karnataka.",
    yantra: "a mechanical or magical device in Hindu mythology."

console.log(dict.yakka);
console.log(dict['yakshagana']);
